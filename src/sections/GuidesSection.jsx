              Start with the Basics
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              Before diving into trends or bold pieces, focus on building a
              solid foundation. Invest your attention in versatile essentials
              like neutral t-shirts, well-fitting jeans, plain button-ups, and a
              classic jacket or blazer. These are the backbone of countless
              outfits and make daily styling less overwhelming.

              Stick to a Cohesive Color Palette
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              Having a consistent color scheme makes your wardrobe more
              versatile. Choose 3–5 base colors that complement your skin tone
              and personal vibe. Add a couple of accent colors to bring variety.
              This makes it easier to create new combinations without clashing
              pieces.

              Fit Is More Important Than Labels
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              Even the most expensive clothes can look sloppy if they don’t fit
              well. Learn what flatters your body shape and consider getting
              clothes tailored for that extra polish. Well-fitted pants, shirts
              that hug your shoulders just right, and jackets that fall cleanly
              elevate your entire outfit effortlessly.

              Master the Art of Layering
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              Layering is both functional and stylish. Start with thinner,
              breathable fabrics and work your way up to heavier layers like
              jackets or coats. Playing with textures (e.g., cotton under denim,
              or wool over linen) adds dimension and visual interest to your
              outfit.

              Balance Proportions in Your Outfits
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              A stylish look often comes down to balancing shapes. If your top
              is loose or oversized, pair it with fitted bottoms like skinny
              jeans or tailored trousers. If you’re wearing wide-leg pants or a
              flowy skirt, balance it with a more form-fitting top. This keeps
              your silhouette intentional and stylish.

              Care for Your Clothes Like They Matter
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
              Good clothes last longer with proper care. Always check care
              labels, avoid overwashing, and learn the difference between
              machine-wash and hand-wash fabrics. Fold sweaters to avoid
              stretching, hang blouses properly, and store items in a way that
              prevents damage and fading.
